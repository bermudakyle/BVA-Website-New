BVA's junior programs wrapped up their 2025 fall season with strong performances from both the Paradise Hitters (junior girls) and Big Wave Riders (junior boys). Both teams participated in regional competitions and several players received recognition for outstanding development.

## Paradise Hitters Highlights

The Paradise Hitters U16 team competed in the ECVA Junior Girls Championship in October, finishing in fourth place — their best-ever result at the regional level. Setter Amara Simmons was named to the All-Tournament team.

The U14 group had an impressive inaugural season, winning their first inter-island friendly match against visiting teams from the Caribbean.

## Big Wave Riders Highlights

The Big Wave Riders U18 squad advanced to the semifinal of the ECVA Junior Boys Championship before falling to eventual champions Trinidad. The team's libero, James Trott, earned the tournament's Best Libero award.

## Looking Ahead to Spring

Registration for the 2026 spring junior programs opens January 15, 2026. Programs are available for ages 10–18, and new players are always welcome. No prior experience is required for beginner and intermediate levels.
