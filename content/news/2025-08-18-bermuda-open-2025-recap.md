The 2025 Bermuda Open Beach Volleyball Tournament was a resounding success, drawing 24 teams from eight countries across three days of competition at Horseshoe Bay Beach. The event ran August 15–17 and featured some of the highest-quality beach volleyball ever played on the island.

## Results

**Men's Draw Winner:** USA — Rodriguez/Castillo
**Women's Draw Winner:** Canada — Fontaine/Beaumont
**Bermuda's Best Finish:** Men's national team (Powell/Tucker) — Quarterfinals

## Highlights

The tournament opened Friday evening with the Mixed Exhibition Match, which drew an estimated 800 spectators to the beach. Saturday's pool play saw several upsets, including Trinidad knocking off the top-seeded Dominican Republic squad in three tight sets.

Bermuda's Powell and Tucker put the crowd on their feet in Sunday's quarterfinal, pushing eventual champions Rodriguez and Castillo to a third set before falling 12–15.

## Looking Ahead

The BVA aims to expand the Bermuda Open to a NORCECA-sanctioned event by 2027. Discussions with regional volleyball federations are ongoing.

Thank you to our volunteers, sponsors, and the Department of Tourism for helping make the Bermuda Open a world-class event.
